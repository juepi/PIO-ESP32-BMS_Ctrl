# Introduction 
This project is intended to be used as an WiFi/MQTT interface to the [Daly Smart BMS Systems](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4165007) based on my [PlatformIO ESP32 Template](https://github.com/juepi/PIO-ESP32-Template).  

## Local Requirements
Please see [PlatformIO ESP32 Template README](https://github.com/juepi/PIO-ESP32-Template) for details. Obviously you will also need a Daly Smart BMS, i have bought the "small" 40A 4S LiFePo4 version for first testing. You will probably need to do the initial battery setup using the included Bluetooth adapter, as the used [library](https://github.com/maland16/daly-bms-uart) to interface to the BMS lateron does not support setting configuration parameters.

## An important notice on connecting the ESP32 to your BMS
Take caution when connecting the ESP to the UART port of the BMS: the internal electronics of the BMS (including UART port) use "battery ground", whereas other connected devices (i.e. load, charger) use the "power ground". **NEVER EVER** connect these different grounds or magic smoke will leave your electronics! To avoid this, make sure to isolate **anything** coming from or going into the UART port of the Daly BMS. For UART RX/TX, a **ADUM1201** isolator chip should suite well, if you want to use the 3.3V power provided by the BMS to power your ESP, also use an isolating DC/DC converter (like the "B0303S-1W" on ali; **see hint below!**). See [this site](https://cppdig.com/c/esp-bridge-allowing-daly-smart-bms-to-be-used-with-a-sofar-invertercharger-and-others-that-use-sma-canbus-protocol) for some details.  
**SUGGESTION:** as watching a few videos from [the Off-Grid Garage](https://www.youtube.com/c/OffGridGarageAustralia) it seems to me that the BMS internal electronics are powered by only a **single cell** of your battery pack (draining ~17mA). This will lead to a unbalanced cell situation by design (probably only relevant for batteries with little capacity though), so i'd recommend you to not power your ESP microcontroller (or any peripherals) from the 3.3V rail coming from the UART connector of the BMS as this would worsen things. Instead, use a small DC/DC converter and power it from the battery pack directly (Battery+ and P- from BMS, where also your charger and load is connected). You have to keep in mind that in an error-situation the BMS will probably cut off the load output, so you have to think of a way to avoid losing the ESP power supply. In my case, i'll be running an AC supply in parallel, but you could also add a supercap in example so that you get the ESP at least to send the error situation to the MQTT broker before shutting off.

## Safety Guide
Keep in mind that you are working with potentially dangerous currents depending on the hardware you use. Take any precautions necessary!

## Status
The code is finished so far, the last (self caused) problem with occasional ESP resets has been solved (hopefully). When i'm in the mood (and have enough spare time), I'll start adding a KiCAD project to the repo to combine all the hardware parts together.

## Insights
- Do not rely on the current reported by the Daly BMS, it is quite inaccurate at low levels. Even worse, **Daly does not recognize charge and discharge currents below 1.1A**, so at small setups like mine, this also means that you cannot rely on the SOC reported by Daly.
- Instead, you could use a [Smart Shunt](https://www.victronenergy.com/battery-monitors/smart-battery-shunt) (expensive solution) or - for small currents - an [INA226](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina226.pdf) breakout board.
- Firmware-upgrading the ESP rarely breaks communication to the Daly BMS. In that case, you need to re-connect the BT-coin and press the button on it, then reconnect the ESP and it will work again. So it would probably be a good idea to wire the "button" (yellow wire on my original Daly BT cable) to an ESP GPIO if possible.. this is a bit nasty and happens every now and then after flashing. I've tried to send an BMS reset command to the Daly when this error occurs, but as expected this does not cure the fault condition.
- set the "sleep waiting time" on the Daly BMS to **35535** to avoid sleep mode
- ~~Disabling the DISCHARGE MOSFET on the Daly-BMS also seems to break charging for my setup. I use a small BQ24650 based MPPT-PV charger, and i assume that disabling the DISCHARGE FET confuses the charger-IC. atm the charger needs a reset by shorting the PV input daily. :-/~~
- Problem above solved by switching the load through a dedicated SSR (GPIO) and not touching the Daly's Discharge FET. **ADVICE on buying solid state relays:** Do **NOT** buy cheap SSRs on Amazon or Ali! They are all bullshit if not even dangerous! There are obviously good reasons why reasonable SSR cost 50EUR and above at serious electronic stores.. I've tried 2 cheap ones from Ali (dead after < 20 switching cycles) and Amazon (caused 0,75W power loss at 1 (!!!) amp load - was supposed to handle 100amps according to seller!). I finally ended up using an [AQW212EH optocoupler](https://industry.panasonic.eu/de/components/relays/relays/photomos-relays/photomos-ge-2-form/aqw212eh-aqw212eh) with a [P-channel MOSFET](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irf5210pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a4015355e3576b198b) to turn the load on and off, which works perfectly well. 
- Daly BMS will enter sleeping mode when battery/cell reaches configured undervoltage. Serial comm will fail at that stage, but recovers when undervoltage condition resolves and BMS comes up again.
- An **active balancer** is recommended, especially with cheap cells you probably won't be very lucky in getting "good matching" cells. I'm logging each cell's voltage and i can see, that 2 cells "run away" when the battery gets full or empty, thus the Daly BMS will stop the charging process due to a single (or more) cells reaching the `bms.alarm.levelOneCellVoltageTooHigh` before the other cells are fully charged. Luckily, [Andy from the Off-Grid Garage has picked up this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPmwrPOwC3g) recently, and i've decided to add the active-balancing control as he "likes to have it" into the firmware. Note that you will need an active balancer that will allow you to start the balancing by shorting 2 pins, like [this one from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004177713396.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.32f81802ay3oVX). You will need to remove the solder chunk from the pads labeled "Run", this will reveal 2 seperate soldering pads. Solder 2 wires to the pads and connect them to an optocoupler output - see AQW212EH above! Luckily you should have one channel left :wink:.
- Concerning **active balancer selection**, you might want to use a capacitive balancer, as these (to my understanding) manage to balance all cells in your battery pack, not just adjacent ones.
- With the active balancer up and running, you might want to disable the (useless) internal passive Daly BMS balancer (BT-coin + Daly App)

## What the code does
Primarily, the code reads Battery-pack and cell status from the Daly BMS and sends it to your MQTT broker and to a locally attached OLED display at a configurable interval. It automatically switches the load-SSR on if the batteries are fully charged (Daly BMS reports `bms.alarm.levelOneCellVoltageTooHigh`) and off if the batteries are drained (measured battery current by the INA226 reaches 0 and battery voltage less than 12.3V - this is a special treatment due to my local redundant setup). Of course the Load-SSR can also be switched manually by setting the corresponding MQTT topic to `on` or `off`.  
As mentioned, the SOC reported by the Daly is incorrect, especially when charging / discharging the battery with < 1.1A. For this reason, the firmware maintains a "calculated SOC", which is based on more accurate voltage and current readouts of the INA226.  
You may manually switch Daly Charge and Discharge FETs on/off through dedicated MQTT topics to `on` or `off`, but be warned that this might confuse your charger, i think due to the Low-side switching nature of the Daly BMS. The code is not automatically handling the Daly FETs, however when monitoring the MQTT topics you will discover, that the BMS itself enables/disables the FETs on demand (in example, battery full -> Charge FET disabled).    
Last but not least, the firmware (starting with v1.1.0) also allows you to handle an external active balancer through an additional SSR as recommended by [Andy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPmwrPOwC3g). However, i have added a second condition beside the 3.4V cell voltage: **we're only enabling the active balancer at a configurable mimimum solar power threshold**. This ensures that balancing only kicks in when the battery is reasonably charging (i have set it to 10W for my small setup).  
To configure the firmware for your needs, see files `user_setup.h` and `mqtt_ota_config.h`, also see [PlatformIO ESP32 Template](https://github.com/juepi/PIO-ESP32-Template) readme (WiFi setup etc.).
