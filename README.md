# Introduction 
This project is intended to be used as an WiFi/MQTT interface to the [Daly Smart BMS Systems](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4165007) based on my [PlatformIO ESP32 Template](https://github.com/juepi/PIO-ESP32-Template).  

## Local Requirements
Please see [PlatformIO ESP32 Template README](https://github.com/juepi/PIO-ESP32-Template) for details. Obviously you will also need a Daly Smart BMS, i have bought the "small" 40A 4S LiFePo4 version for first testing. You will probably need to do the initial battery setup using the included Bluetooth adapter, as the used [library](https://github.com/maland16/daly-bms-uart) to interface to the BMS lateron does not support setting configuration parameters.

## An important notice on connecting the ESP32 to your BMS
Take caution when connecting the ESP to the UART port of the BMS: the internal electronics of the BMS (including UART port) use "battery ground", whereas other connected devices (i.e. load, charger) use the "power ground". **NEVER EVER** connect these different grounds or magic smoke will leave your electronics! To avoid this, make sure to isolate **anything** coming from or going into the UART port of the Daly BMS. For UART RX/TX, a **ADUM1201** isolator chip should suite well, if you want to use the 3.3V power provided by the BMS to power your ESP, also use an isolating DC/DC converter (like the "B0303S-1W" on ali; **see hint below!**). See [this site](https://cppdig.com/c/esp-bridge-allowing-daly-smart-bms-to-be-used-with-a-sofar-invertercharger-and-others-that-use-sma-canbus-protocol) for some details.
**SUGGESTION:** as watching a few videos from [the off grid garage](https://www.youtube.com/c/OffGridGarageAustralia) it seems to me that the BMS internal electronics are powered by only a **single cell** of your battery pack (draining ~17mA). This will lead to a unbalanced cell situation by design (probably only relevant for batteries with little capacity though), so i'd recommend you to not power your ESP microcontroller (or any peripherals) from the 3.3V rail coming from the UART connector of the BMS as this would worsen things. Instead, use a small DC/DC converter and power it from the battery pack directly (Battery+ and P- from BMS, where also your charger and load is connected). You have to keep in mind that in an error-situation the BMS will probably cut off the load output, so you have to think of a way to avoid losing the ESP power supply. In my case, i'll be running an AC supply in parallel, but you could also add a supercap in example so that you get the ESP at least to send the error situation to the MQTT broker before shutting off.

## Credits
Thanks to [maland16 and softwarecrash](https://github.com/maland16/daly-bms-uart) for providing a library to interact with the Daly Smart BMS.

## Safety Guide
Keep in mind that you are working with potentially dangerous currents depending on the hardware you use. Take any precautions necessary!

## Status
This is early work-in-progress, as my Daly-BMS along with all other required parts have not yet arrived. If everything works as expected, a hardware part might follow, that combines all required bits and pieces on a single PCB.

# Version History

## v0.1.0
- Initial Commit, only integrated a small 128x32 OLED which will be used to display some status later on

## v0.2.0
- Added Daly BMS library and some code - compiles, but untested (my hardware still not arrived yet)
